# react_app

The second iteration of [react-app](https://github.com/louisritchie/react-app), Louis's nice portfolio frontend.

## Development Environment

In one terminal, run `npm run watch` and in another, run `npm start`.

The first is the watched webpack build, and the second is a bash script to restart the server when the build is updated.

## TODO

1. update RXJS version.

## Useful remnants of CRA Readme.
